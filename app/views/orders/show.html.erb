          <!-- ## At line 18 order is a object representing an order and because it has a relationship to line items you can do .line_items which returns an array of all line objects 

          ## A cart item is a hash - item[:product] - key value pairs
          ## In JS object is key value pair list - which is what hash is in Ruby - but in ruby which is OOP language - an object is an instance of a class 
          ## but a order item is an object - to know what 

          ## with true object syntax I then have to use dot notation because in Ruby bracket notation is almost strictly for hashes 

          ## render on the left is a rail method - which wants to render a partial with the name 'item' and it's passing the following data to that partial - passing product / passsing quantity
          
          ## with only hashtags this displays - it needed to be commented in HTML
